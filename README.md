# most-popular-words
 Count the N most popular words that are longer than M letters.

 Implement an application for reading Read.me files from every user's (for example Spotify) 
 public GitHub repository and count the 3 most popular words that are longer than 4 letters.
 You can use any framework or trick that you like to make your code shorter and faster, Java is the one limitation. 
 The application can be CLI or a simple web service, wrapping it to the docker container would be a nice bonus.

How to run :  `docker image build -t most-popular-words:latest .`
 `docker run most-popular-words:latest`
